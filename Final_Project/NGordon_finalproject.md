I created this final project for my Intro to Python class. You can run the program normally and it will lead you through a series of situations and possible actions, with a few different ways to 'win' the game.

The most difficult part about creating this was adding different concepts that we learned, and debugging. It was too easy to just use groups of conditionals, so even though I think that is the most standard part of a text-based adventure, I tried to include other elements like a tuple and a class.

Another difficult part was the actual game flow and figuring out how to translate strings of actions into logical processes through code. For example, I couldn't understand how to continue the code into my third action using functions, so I took those out and created a simpler way using sub-conditional layers.

I will most likely come back to this game once I have more time and can take a more in-depth look at it. But I hope you enjoy!
